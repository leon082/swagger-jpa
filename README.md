## Backend
Go to the terminal and work your way to the folder containing the source code and run the following command:

```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application backend should now be up and running in `localhost:8080`. and you can test through [Swagger!](http://localhost:8080/com.technical.test.app/swagger-ui.html#/)
